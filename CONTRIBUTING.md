CRG Scoreboard is created by the community, and welcomes contributions of all kinds. Some areas that we especially appreciate contributions in are:

- improvements to these wiki pages
- reporting issues and unexpected behavior
- testing
- new or improved technical documentation


## Contributing to the wiki

Anyone can add to the scoreboard wiki pages, so if you see an area that doesn't have much documentation, we encourage you to add it! If you are unsure about your changes or would like feedback before editing the wiki, feel free to open an issue to discuss it.
